# crochet3d
what this does:
turns a 3d model (ply format) into a crochet pattern, with a colour pallet and line-by-line that you can follow.
you have control over the height of the model (from tip to toe and measured in stitches)

sorry about requirements couldnt get that to work. Im going to explain this one becasue i had loads of trouble getting it set up. Open3d is really annoying and you'll probably have to do something completely different to what i did. Anyway it kept giving me dll initialiastion errors or something which seemed pretty much unfixable. so i had to be running it in python 3.8 with the open3d version 13.0. Ive read it also depends on hardware? anyway thats all. Bit of a mess at the moment prints loads of colours to screen and sometimes the visualiser crashes (not me thats becasue of open3d) also its only accepts a file called Tawana.ply so youll have to change this.
